<h1>
    Writing an arbitrary size integer type in C#
</h1>

<body>
    <p>
        Sometimes you might see websites no longer being able to display some basic statistics about
        a piece of content hosted there(e.g view counts, likes, interactions, etc) and instead
        that figure would be replaced by something like: '4b+ views', what is the reason behind that?
    </p>
    <p>I will try to blindly solve this problem, while attempting to optimize it </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Part 0: how numbers are represented in the CPU</h2>
    <p>feel free to skip this if you are familiar with computer science basics.</p>
    <p>
        As is well known, computers use 1s and 0s(also called binary) to represent all values and logic, but how is
        that done, and how does it relate to our problem?
    </p>
    <p>
        on a piece of paper, when we write a number, we use the base 10 system, where every 10
        numbers, we move to the next position, and we have 10 glyphs to represent all
        values(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) like when computing 7 + 9, we dont have a unique glyph for it that
        represents the value fourteen, instead we add the two values together until we have a number larger than 9,
        then we move it to a new position and put the remaining value in the original position
        which is why we end up with 14, and these rules can be extended ad infinitum to represent any
        natural number.
    </p>
    <p>
        Applying the same rules to a base 2 number gives us binary numbers, which are the numbers
        that can be computed by the CPU, and just like base 10 has 10 glyphs, base 2 has 2 glyphs
        to represent all possible values(0, 1).
    </p>
    <p>
        While it might seem impossible, if we apply the previous rules, you will find that it
        holds true even for this small value.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's try 1 + 1, where usually we will write 2, but since we don't have a glyph for that value
        we move it to the left and write the remainder in the original position, ending with: 10
        which doesn't represent ten in binary, but two, now we can add one to two: 10 + 01 and end up
        with 11, which isn't eleven but three in binary.
    </p>
    <p>
        We only explained why it's possible to represent all possible numbers, not why it restricts the range
        of values that websites can display, and that reason is: computers don't use that system internally.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead, when computers store a number, they store all the available positions that number can use
        to represent a value, and the most common number of positions used to represent numbers is
        32, which is why many languages call 'int's i32, 'i' means integer and '32' is how many positions
        (which are represented bits) that number contains, and we can calculate the range of all
        possible values for a given number of bits through this formula:
    </p>
    <p>
        (max = 2^(n)-1, min = 0) where 'n' is the number of bits, giving us (4,294,967,295 - 0) for 32 bit
        numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
        P.S: for simplicity we wont discuss negatives, you can <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_number_representations">visit wikipedia</a> to learn
        about them.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Part 1: Incrementing</h3>
        <p>
            To eliminate the issue related to limited range number representations, we have to first create
            a type that is made of something that we can grow and use easily, in this case an array will
            suffice, but an array of what?
        </p>
        <ul>
            <p>
                Possible types:
            </p>
            <li>
                <p>
                    String: has issues related to restricting users from putting
                    non-number characters in the string, and also writing all the arithmetic operations between
                    number strings isnt trivial, using a 'char' won't solve these problems either.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Integer: already implements arithmetic operations and is restricted to only number
                    values, will also help us in optimizing our program in the future.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The first thing we must do is implement the base functionality, the requirements are simple:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>be able to describe any finite natural number</li>
            <li>be able to increment that number</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let's take a number: 1239, once incremented we expect to find: 1240, but we need
            to first breakdown the steps to understand how we came to that conclusion.</p>
        <p>First we breakdown the number into a list of digits, and sort it from largest
            to smallest position magnitude</p>
        <p>lastly, we will simply add one to the smallest position each time, like this:</p>

        <details class="source-container">
            <summary>View Source Code</summary>
            <pre><code class="language-csharp" id="code-block-1"></code></pre>
        </details>
        <br>
        <div class="imagewrapper"><img src="increment 1.png" alt=""></div>

        <p>We didn't take into account how the values would propogate between positions, meaning that now
            we will have to detect and handle carries, like in a full adder by propogating it to the next position.
        </p>
        <p>For the sake of simplicity, we will use recursion to first increment the least significant position, and
            then if we detect a carry, propogate the increment to the next position, until we either have no more
            carries or the carry overflows and we can no longer propogate it due to our number's size.
        </p>
        <p>also, due to the way C# works, we will use a class to encapsulate logic to make it easier to work with.</p>
        <details class="source-container">
            <summary>View Source Code</summary>
            <pre><code class="language-csharp" id="code-block-2"></code></pre>
        </details>
        <br>
        <div class="imagewrapper"><img src="increment 2.png" alt=""></div>
        <p>Great! Now we have solved the issues related to carry propogation, but if we look at the source
            code, the number: 999 increments to 000, which is expected since it overflowed, but isn't that the
            problem we were trying to solve in the first place?
        </p>
        <p>
            We have to figure out how to expand our numbers dynamically, instead of having to guess how many
            positions we need in our object before using it, this can be easily done by running a function 'expand()'
            if we detect an overflow increment, and then increment the new position, which will require a rewrite
            of some functions, since now the most significant number will be the one with the higher index, making
            expansion trivial, and we will also make 'ToString()' return a normal number string.
        </p>
        <details class="source-container">
            <summary>View Source Code</summary>
            <pre><code class="language-csharp" id="code-block-3"></code></pre>
        </details>
        <p>
            Now we can finally increment our objects until we have no more room in memory, but we still have
            problems, using the class feels awkward, and we can't use it meaningfully since we can't decrement numbers
            yet, nor can we perform large additions/substractions at once.
        </p>
        </p>
        <h2>Part 2: decrementing</h2>
        <p>
            First we have to understand how to decrement, and what functionalities we need to add to make
            decrementation possible, and the best first step is to solve the easiest case:
            5 - 1 = 4
            We will just subtract 1 from the least significant position, and we will end up with the correct
            result.
        </p>
        <p>From now on we will only show code snippets and not the entire source.</p>
        <details class="source-container">
            <summary>View Source Code</summary>
            <pre><code class="language-csharp" id="code-block-4"></code></pre>
        </details>
        <p>
            The first number was decremented correctly, but the second number's
            nonesensical output shows that this naive solution can't propogate decrementation
            just like our initial incrementation logic, but how do we solve it?
        </p>
        <p>
            It's clear that we need to somehow affect other positions, and the first obvious
            step is to check for wrap arounds(when a number goes above 9 or below 0).
        </p>
        <details class="source-container">
            <summary>View Source Code</summary>
            <pre><code class="language-csharp" id="code-block-5"></code></pre>
        </details>
        <p>Finally! now we can see both '998' and '09', which are the correct solutions.</p>
        <p>
            Almost exactly like the solution for incrementing numbers, instead we wrap
            the number up to 9 and don't expand the number if we happen to propogate the operation
            to a new position, else we will have an infinite recursion condition where the number
            paradoxically grows to infinity for some decrement cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Technically, our program is complete now, all possible arithmetic operations on a natural
            number can be performed, summation is just group incrementation, subtraction is group
            decrementation, multiplication is group addition and finally division is just group division with
            extra logic if we want to also calculate remainders.
        </p>
        <details class="source-container">
            <summary>View Source Code</summary>
            <pre><code class="language-csharp" id="code-block-6"></code></pre>
        </details>
        <p>
            As we can see, the solution is trivial, and it didn't take much effort to implement, which will
            be true for the other arithmetic oeprations, but as you might have noticed if you read the
            source, the run time is horrible, with non-constant time to perform addition, let alone the other
            operations we have to implement, and also considering that each position represents an 'int', which
            in C# is a 32 bit signed integer, means that we use only 4 bits out of 32, leaving 28 bits empty
            and not utilizing it, we have to find a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is where the use if integer types over strings to represent our positions becomes
            useful, as we can simply replace 'int's with 'byte', which is a type that is only 8 bits large, or
            a single byte large, it would still mean that we waste 50% of our memory, but having the numbers closer
            together in the memroy means that we can cram more of them into the cache, greatly improving memory
            access speeds, hopefully making processes with a lot of numbers much faster, also allowing
            us to use bitwise operations in the future to use 100% of the bits(technically less since BCD
            has 16 possible values while decimal numbers only have 10 values for each position) to represent numbers.
        </p>

        <p>
            This had negligible effects on performance, proving once again, that
            "Premature optimization is the root of all evil." as said by donald knuth.
        </p>
        <p>
            to see real gains, we have to perform real addition on our numbers, and not just increment
            one by the amout of the other in an odd loop, which more observant readers will realize
            is buggy, since we rely on a not too clever hack to compare the value of two numbers, which itself
            adds to the performance overhead.
        </p>
        <p>
            Right now we have two clear goals:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Implement true summation between two number objects.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Implement a comparator between two number objects.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Part 3: Summation and Comparison</h2>
        <p>
            The first and easier step right now is to do comparison, it also will make it clearer why the
            'NaiveSum()' function performed so poorly.
        </p>
        <p>
            To do that we will simply overload the '&gt;' and '&lt;' operators in C#, as it will give us a cleaner and
            easier to use interface to compare two of our numbers, which leads us to wonder how we could start comparing
            two numbers, if we can't use the previous hack to return a value representing our objects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Visualizing the operations will help us see patterns and edge cases we might have not seen through
            purely writing the solution in code:
        </p>
        <div class="imagewrapper"><img src="compare 1.png" alt=""></div>
        <p>
            We will start from most significant position to the least, so we can benefit from early exists where
            we don't have to compare every single value in the internal list of both numbers, like in the
            example where we return the result by merely finding the first different pair of numbers, since by necessity
            this means that the lower number must be larger than the upper one, althought this approach will cause us
            trouble
            since we will have to handle more edge cases, which also help us in discovering more early exists.
        </p>
        <p>
            The firs practical problem we have to solve is preceding zeros, since there is a possibility of a number
            having its most significant position all the way to the first position be all zeros given the appropriate
            set of operations performed on that number, so we have to skip all these numbers before doing any
            comparison,
            which is best shown through the code itself.
        </p>

        </details>
        <p>
            After that we can benefit from our approach and do a very easy length check for both number
            to see which is shorter, and therefore has the smaller/larger value, otherwise we do the final
            check where we implement the example shown in the figure above, comparing the positions until
            we find the first difference and return either true or false depending on whether we used '&gt;'
            or '&lt;'.
        </p>

        </details>
        <p>
            Running the performance test again, we see a huge improvement:
        </p>
        <p>
            '123 + 654' went from ~5ms to ~3.5ms, while not great its still impressive
            how optimizing a simple check boosted performance that much.
        </p>
        <p>
            '1,000,000 + 1,000,000' thought went from ~700ms to...23ms! the overhead of
            the check for large numbers seems to be much much more important, and we got
            > 20x performance gains from getting rid of the previous hack.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the comparison is technically not constant-time, i assume that
            the early exits are going to be frequent enough that on average, it will
            be a constant time operation.
        </p>
        <p>
            After all this hard work, we can finally get rid of all the performance
            benefits since we are going to reimplement summation itself to be
            a constant time operation with no comparisons, which will hopefully make adding numbers of
            different sizes not have the vast run times we see still.
        </p>
        <p>
            The approach that most immediately came to me is sum every position and propogate
            the carry to the next one, just like addition but with less assumptions and more edge
            cases, although it shouldn't be nearly as complicated as the comparisons were(hopefully).
        </p>
        <p>
            It's worth it to note that what we are doing right now is very similar to an operation
            that happens in old CPUs, with a component called the
            '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)#Full_adder">Full adder</a>'.
        </p>
        <div class="imagewrapper"><img src="summation 1.png" alt=""></div>
        <p>
            We re-adapted the increment logic to work for adding large numbers, this approach also isn't
            constant time, but it's as close as i can get it without having to do SIMD and bit-packing, which
            will have problems since BCDs(Binary Coded Decimals) have boundries that don't align with how
            bits are packed in a SIMD vector.

        <p>
            This solution is almost-constant time, making it not blow up with larger numbers, and also happens
            to be much faster, although sadly it's not as fast as i had hoped it would be:
        </p>
        <p>
            '9,999,999 + 9,999,999' was done in ~280ms using 'NaiveSum()', this is especially bad
            since the function scales with the value of the number to be added instead of the number of
            positions, shown in '1,000,000,000 + 999,999,999' that took ~26,900ms!
        </p>
        <p>
            '9,999,999 + 9,999,999' was done in ~3.5ms, great but still not the micro-second level performance
            we might have expected, '1,000,000,000 + 999,999,999' was also done in ~3.5ms, proving that
            'almost-constant' is a valid peformance measure.
