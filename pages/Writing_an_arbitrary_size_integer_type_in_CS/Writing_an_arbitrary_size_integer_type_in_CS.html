    <h2>Part 1: Writing the first prototype</h3>
        <p>The first thing we must do is implement the base type, the requirements are simple:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>be able to describe any finite natural number</li>
            <li>be able to increment that number</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let's take a number: 1239, once incremented we expect to find: 1240, but we need</p>
        <p>to first breakdown the steps to understand how we came to that conclusion.</p>
        <p>first we breakdown the number into a list of digits, and sort it from largest
            to smallest position magnitude</p>
        <p>first 1, then 2, then 3, then 9</p>
